            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a main/common repository for all project files where members of a group can make changes to a file by checking in and checking out files. This system solves the problem of file sharing because it records all changes to a specific file so a member can look back at previous versions later on. This system is valuable because it allows you to revert files to previous states, compare changes, view who modified a file last and when it was done, see the cause of a problem, merge changes to a single file and much more. Even if you are not working with a group of people, this system still serves as a backup for all files so no work is lost. A version control system is vital to easily recover a file or set of files which is essential for web designers. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">    Git is an open source and free distributed version control system that is used to handle any project size with speed and effectiveness. It outshines other SCM tools because it works with multiple workflows, low cost local branching and has favorable staging areas. Git ensures that each user has a full copy of the repository data stored locally on their machine so you can work easily off of it. It also ensures that there will be no overwrite issues on shared files. The three basic steps of Git is Add, Commit and Push. Git works in a way that it thinks of the data stored as a stream of snapshots. For example, when you “commit” a file, Git takes a snapshot of what all the files look like at that moment so it can act as a reference. Git is also so efficient to utilize because it only needs local files to function which helps in looking up files from a long time ago. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Stages</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git goes through three main stages that files can occupy in- committed, modified and staged. The committed stage refers to when the data is stored in the local database. The modified stage is when you have changed the file in some way but have not committed it to the database yet. Lastly, staged means that you have marked a modified file in the current version it is in to go into your commit snapshot. Git also has three sections of a project- directory, working tree and staging area. The Git directory is where the system stores the metadata and object database for a project. This is what is copied when you clone a repository from another machine. The working tree section is considered the single checkout of a single version of a project. The files used in this stage are pulled out of the compressed database in the directory and placed on a disk to use or for modification. The staging area is a file that stores information about what will be next committed. It is often referred to as the “index.” </p>

       <!-- Fourth Featurette -->

                <span class="text-muted">Remote Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git has two repositories, one is called the remote repository. The remote repository is often referred to as the centralized server. This means that when a group of people are working on files together then this base can be on a central server where people can retrieve files and commit. The remote repository is the one that is shared by the team and the team can “push” commits to it when they are ready to share with the other members. The “push” command updates the remote repository by copying that file that was updated from the local repository to the remote repository. The remote repository can also be used as a backup if you are working indecently and not necessarily with a team.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Local Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The other repository that Git uses is called the local repository. The local repository is used solely on your own machine and only for your direct use. The local repository contains all the files and their commit history. In order to create a local repository from a remote repository, you use the Git “clone” command which creates a local repository from all of the remote repositories history. You utilize the “clone” command only once in order to initially pull all the files and history from the remote repository.  The “merge” command merges all the contents from the local repository into the workspace.  The “commit” command commits the staged files into the local repository. </p>
